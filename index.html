				My auntie calls me "Itchy Feet" because she says that I spend most of my time walking around outside instead of staying at home. Let's hang out together in Singapore!

			<h2>Walking Around</h2>
			<p>
				Walking around Singapore and having self-dates is what I consider to be the ultimate form of self-care. 😌

			<h2>Marketing</h2>
			<p>
				I find the Marketing subject in high school and college to be really fascinating as my educators have shown me that Marketing is more than just making advertisements - it is all about understanding the needs, wants, and demands, of people, and thinking of sophisticated strategies in order for your product offerings to reach your target market.

			<h2>Food Trips</h2>
			<p>
				As Singapore is known as a very large food hub, my stay in the country has given me the opportunity to try out food from many different cuisines! My favorite dish that I have tried is the Char Kway Teow in Lorong 9 of Geylang.
